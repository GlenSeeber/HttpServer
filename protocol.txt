Messages will be of uncertain length.

This protocol will be based off of HTTP, might be exactly,
but I don't know enough about it to say for sure:

	- First, send the length of your message in hexidecimal, appended with "\r\n".

	- Then, send your chunk, also appended with "\r\n".



We will operate on client-driven query-response system:

	- In all connections, the client sends the first message.

	- The server will interpret the message, and send a response.

	- The server will not send unprompted messages.

	- The server will send exactly 1 message response to each query made by
		the client. In cases where the query isn't interpretable, the server
		will send back an error response.
	
	- Both the client and server could close the connection based on context.
