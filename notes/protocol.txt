Messages are all prepended with a fixed size header.

	- Header is 4 bytes (4 characters).

	- It will contain a base-10 number for how many bytes are in the body
		of the actual message.

	- The other computer will then read the header, then read exactly as many
		bytes as is stated in the header, no more.

	- If the number takes less than 4 bytes, pad the header with whitespace
		(i like to use \t), but it doesn't really matter what you use probably.



Note: current protocol won't be able to send more than a few thousand bytes per
	transmission.



We will operate on client-driven query-response system:

	- In all connections, the client sends the first message.

	- The server will interpret the message, and send a response.

	- The server will not send unprompted messages.

	- The server will send exactly 1 message response to each query made by
		the client. In cases where the query isn't interpretable, the server
		may send back an error response.
	
	- Both the client and server could close the connection based on context.
