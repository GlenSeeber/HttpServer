The protocol is the Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)



This server will accept 2 requests: POST and GET.



Basic concepts:

	- HTTP is stateless.

	- Query-based protocol, driven by the client posting requests.


Our server:

	- We will be serving html and css. After the prototype, we might upgrade to
		including javascript that talks to the server.

	- It's mostly just to prove that I can do backend, so don't worry too much
		about making it pretty to look at.
