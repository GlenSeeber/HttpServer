What's going wrong:

	- Client is having a connection error.

Likely causes:

	- input IP address is wrong (as in, the server does not exist there)

	- something was mistyped in the connect line

	- something is wrong with the servaddr values

Other notes:

	- your errors do nothing to stop the program from continuing. this
		will make debugging somewhat harder if you miss an error output.


IMPORTANT UPDATE:

	- looks like the error is saying that "Connection Refused" (ECONNREFUSED) 
		which the man page for connect(2) says is because the client "found
		no one listening on the remote address".
